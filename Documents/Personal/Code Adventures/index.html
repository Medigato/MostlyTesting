    <p> You are born. </p>
    
    <p> Your world is dizziness and confusion. The rest you had been used to appeared to be over, you breathe your first breath. </p>
        
    <p>Then immediately start bawling your heart out. </p>
    
    <p> The first months are chaos, but exactly //random number of days between 24 and 36, you recognize something in the shadows.  </p>

    <p> You extend your hand and grab the first fiber of understanding. The face amongst the blurriness is looking directly at us.  </p>
    <p> And they're smiling. </p>
    <p> Suddenly, you feel an irrestible urge. </p>

    <!-- Buttons that add or remove fireflies, most of the actions are buttons. -->
